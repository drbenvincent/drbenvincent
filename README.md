### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a (soon to be ex-) Cognitive Scientist with a focus on Bayesian methods. From September 2022 I quit my faculty position and I will become a full time Bayesian data scientist.

These days I code in Python, R, and Julia. Some of my repo's support scientific publications, but you'll also find teaching materials, my own learning and experimentation, and some just-for-fun projects.

# Open source contributions - Bayesian inference with PyMC
I am also a contributor to [PyMC](http://docs.pymc.io), focussing my efforts on writing examples to educate and inform about Bayesian modelling. I've covered the following topics:
- [Binomial regression](https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/pymc-examples/examples/generalized_linear_models/GLM-binomial-regression.html)
- [Simpson's Paradox and mixed models](https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/pymc-examples/examples/generalized_linear_models/GLM-simpsons-paradox.html)
- [Bayesian regression with truncated or censored data](https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/pymc-examples/examples/generalized_linear_models/GLM-truncated-censored-regression.html), and I have also contributed to the [Censored data](https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/pymc-examples/examples/survival_analysis/censored_data.html) example
- [Bayesian mediation analysis](https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/pymc-examples/examples/case_studies/mediation_analysis.html)
- [Bayesian moderation analysis](https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/pymc-examples/examples/case_studies/moderation_analysis.html)
- [Gaussian mixture models](https://docs.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/mixture_models/gaussian_mixture_model.html)
- [Regression discontinuity design analysis](https://docs.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/case_studies/regression_discontinuity.html)
